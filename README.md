# Game-Dev-Tycoon-Save-Exporter
Exports data from Game Dev Tycoon save files

Requires Python (and some python modules)

Example usage: python '.\gdt save reader.py' 'file__0.localstorage' 
This assumes the python file and your save file are in the same location, and your command shell is in that location too :) 

Sorry it's not a full GUI or easier to use etc! Provided open source and as-is, I guess!
